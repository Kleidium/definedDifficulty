## General:

This mod's settings are applied before the vanilla difficulty slider is taken into account, and is based on its difficulty setting.

The default values are applied as percentages, but can be changed to flat values in most cases. The game can be made easier as well as harder. Dynamic Difficulty by NullCascade is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for use alongside this mod to affect the difficulty slider dynamically over time. Health/Attribute gains for NPCs can be dynamic (changes alongside your difficulty) or static (keeps the stats they were assigned when they were first met even when difficulty changes).
